We are happy to announce Stalwart JMAP, an open-source JSON Meta Application Protocol server written in Rust that aims to be scalable, robust and secure.

Some of its key features are:

* JMAP Core, JMAP Mail and JMAP over WebSocket full compliance.
* IMAP4 rev2/1 support via [Stalwart IMAP](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/imap-server), an imap-to-jmap proxy.
* Scalable and fault tolerant: consensus over Raft, node autodiscovery over gossip and read-only replicas.
* RocksDB backend with full-text search support in 17 languages.
* OAuth 2.0 authorization code and device authorization flows.
* Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) message signing.
* Written in Rust.
* No third-party software required to run or scale.

Currently Stalwart JMAP requires an SMTP server such as Postfix in order to receive e-mails. However, the next item on the roadmap is to release an SMTP server in Rust with the goal of making self-hosting an e-mail server much simpler without sacrificing any security.
