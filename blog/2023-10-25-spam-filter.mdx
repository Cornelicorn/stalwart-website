In today's digital age, the safety and authenticity of your emails are paramount. With that in mind, we're happy to announce the release of the **Spam and Phishing filter** in Stalwart Mail Server v0.4.0. This release is packed with features that not only enhance your email security but also ensure a seamless communication experience.

Here's a deep dive into what's new:

### Comparative Analysis

While we have immense respect for both RSpamd and SpamAssassin, it's essential to highlight some distinctions. RSpamd stands out for its speed and standalone capabilities but necessitates additional configuration and maintenance. Meanwhile, SpamAssassin, built on Perl, might not deliver the same speed as RSpamd due to its heavy reliance on regular expressions.

Stalwart Mail Server's spam and phishing filter offers a level of protection equivalent to both RSpamd and SpamAssassin with one notable advantage: **speed**. Since the message remains within the server during the entire filtering process, it's considerably quicker. Furthermore, while third-party solutions re-execute checks for DMARC, DKIM, SPF, and ARC, Stalwart has already performed these, making our built-in filter more efficient and streamlined.

In essence, with Stalwart Mail Server, you receive a blend of speed, efficiency, and top-tier protection.

### Conclusion

In essence, with Stalwart Mail Server v0.4.0, you're not just getting an email server, but a comprehensive, fast, and efficient email security solution.

We're committed to continuous innovation and ensuring that your communication remains genuine, secure, and spam-free. Upgrade to Stalwart Mail Server v0.4.0 and experience the difference today!
