# Integer

Integers can be represented as a negative or positive whole number without a decimal point, for example:

```toml
positive_integer = 42
negative_integer = -42
```

It's important to note that in TOML, integers cannot contain leading zeros or a plus sign before the number. Integers can be used as values for keys or as elements in arrays.
