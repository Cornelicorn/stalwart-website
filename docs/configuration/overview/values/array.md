# Array

Arrays are sequences of values that can be of any type, including strings, integers, booleans or any other type. Arrays are represented using square brackets `[]` and are separated by commas `,`. For example:

```toml
array_of_strings = [ "apple", "banana", "cherry" ]
array_of_integers = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
