# Operators

The following logical, arithmetic and comparison operators can be used within an expression:

- **Arithmetical:**
    - `+`: Addition
    - `-`: Subtraction
    - `/`: Division
    - `*`: Multiplication
    
- **Logical:**
    - `&&`: Logical AND
    - `||`: Logical OR
    - `^`: Logical XOR
    - `!`: Logical NOT
    
- **Comparison:**
    - `>`: Greater than
    - `<`: Less than
    - `=`: Equal to
    - `!=`: Not equal to
    - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    - `<=`: Less than or equal to

When working with logical and comparison operators, it is crucial to ensure that the data types being compared are compatible. For instance, comparing a string to a number using an operator like `>` may not yield the expected results. Always ensure that the variables and constants in your expressions have expected and consistent types to avoid unexpected behaviors.
