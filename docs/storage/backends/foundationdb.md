# FoundationDB

FoundationDB is recommended for distributed environments, as it is designed for high-scale, fault-tolerant and distributed systems. FoundationDB's capabilities, including its ability to handle large volumes of data across many machines while maintaining consistency and performance, make it a good fit for distributed scenarios.

Settings for your FoundationDB cluster are retrieved from the `fdb.cluster` file.

On the other hand, FoundationDB is recommended for larger, distributed installations involving multiple servers or when catering to millions of users. This is due to its robust scalability, fault tolerance, and support for multi-version concurrency control.
