# FoundationDB

FoundationDB is recommended for distributed environments, as it is designed for high-scale, fault-tolerant and distributed systems. FoundationDB's capabilities, including its ability to handle large volumes of data across many machines while maintaining consistency and performance, make it a good fit for distributed scenarios.

Settings for your FoundationDB cluster are retrieved from the `fdb.cluster` file.
